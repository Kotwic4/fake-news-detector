# Colab notebooks

Here are few notebooks, that are designed to be used on Google Colab(one can just click link and copy notebooks to that platform).

However this notebooks are usual notebooks, so they will also work with jupyter notebook.

Notebooks:

 * [flair](flair.ipynb) - training flair models
 
 * [autokeras](autokeras.ipynb) - training autokeras models
 
 * [autokeras_overfit](autokeras_overfit.ipynb) - training autokeras models to overfit(give validation data to autokeras as validation data)
